# Sonar Rock vs. Mine Classification â€” Logistic Regression

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project leverages **Logistic Regression** to classify sonar signals as either **Rock** or **Mine**. The model is trained and evaluated using the **Sonar dataset**  This serves as a straightforward but strong baseline for binary classification of acoustic data.

**Workflow Explanation**

Sonar Data: Collect the raw sonar dataset.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for modeling.

Train-Test Split: Divide the dataset into training and testing subsets.

Logistic Regression Model: Train a logistic regression model using the training data.

Prediction: Use the trained model to predict whether new inputs are Rock (R) or Mine (M).

## ðŸ“Š Results

- **Training Accuracy**: **83%**
- **Testing Accuracy**: **76%**
- Logistic Regression serves as a competitive baseline for acoustic signal classification using this dataset.
